	<h2>POPPY STALEY</h2>
<p>THEY/THEM</p>
	<p>Poppy Staley is 17 years old and is currently living in Ballarat although they commute to Melbourne to study. They have been making art since childhood and realised early on, around 12 years old that it was something they wanted to make a career out of. Staley works in a variety of materials, whatever medium their idea has they will use it. Their work touches on many themes and ideas such as LGBTQIA+ expression, mental illness, personal experiences, friends, and sometimes absolutely nothing. Everyday things inspire their art such as street sounds, people talking, empty rooms and the corners of their peripheral vision. They have a wide variety of artists who they admire and draw inspiration from, such as Yayoi Kusama, Dev Haynes, Aphex Twin, Jean Michel, Wes Anderson, Minus tw√∏, Junji ito, Rei Kawakubo, Jean Paul Gaultier, their friends and themself.</p>
