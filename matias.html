	<h2>MATIAS GARCIA ARCE</h2>
	<p>ANY PRONOUNS</p>
	<p>Matias Garcia Arce is 18 years old and currently living in Melbourne. They were born and raised in Mexico and can fluently speak Spanish. Art is something he has loved making since childhood and began seriously considering it as a career option when they entered year 10. Garcia Arce predominantly works in graphite pencils and markers but is aiming to branch out and explore different materials. His artwork often reflects and centres around his own experiences and perceptions of the world. Music is something that greatly inspires their art making as it is essential in Matiasâ€™ self expression. Other artists that inspire him are Jean-Michel Basquiat, MF DOOM and Junji Ito.
